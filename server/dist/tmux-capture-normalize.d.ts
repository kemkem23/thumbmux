/**
 * tmux 3.4 serializes a narrow base promoted by VS16 as the grapheme followed
 * by one ASCII continuation cell. For example, a pane containing `A❤️B` is
 * returned by `capture-pane` as `A❤️ B`; an intentional space becomes two.
 * CJK and intrinsically-wide emoji do not receive that extra byte.
 *
 * Thumbmux already renders the promoted unit as a two-cell `.mtv-w2` box, so
 * retaining tmux's continuation byte makes the following glyph and cursor one
 * cell too far right. Remove exactly one such byte while preserving ANSI/OSC
 * sequences and every intentional additional space.
